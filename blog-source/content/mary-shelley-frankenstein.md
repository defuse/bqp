I found so much more in the pages of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" than the pop
culture image of the famous monster would have had me predict. The book is more
a work of science fiction and philosophy of ethics than a horror story. I was
greatly inspired by the adventurous and curious spirits of the two stars of the
story -- both ardent scientists. The ingenious language Mary Shelly used to
convey the story kept me turning page after page.

That's all I have to say.
