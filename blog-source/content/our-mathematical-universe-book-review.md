The first book I ever read was "Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid"
(GEB) by Douglas Hofstadter. Of course it's not *really* the first book I ever
read, but I consider it to be, since it's the first book I *actually paid
attention to*. It set me off on a years-long reading frenzy to which I owe much
of my current knowledge and happiness. I read GEB in early 2013, and despite
reading many books since, it has remained my favorite. Until today.

Today, I finished Max Tegmark's "Our Mathematical Universe," which replaces GEB
as my favorite book. But only slightly: GEB is a very close second.

Our Mathematical Universe begins with a breathtaking popular science overview of
inflation theory and the evidence for it, and then delves into Tegmark's
Mathematical Universe Hypothesis. Even if you aren't interested in the
Mathematical Universe Hypothesis, the book is worth reading just for the
extremely well-done explanation of established science.

Tegmark builds up a heirarchy of multiverses, some of which are implied by
already-established scientific theories, others are more controversial:

- **The Level I multiverse:** Our universe is *really big* and if you go far
  enough, you'll find an area of space that looks so similar to our own area of
  space that we can call it a parallel universe.

- **The Level II multiverse:** Like the Level I multiverse, but *really, really
  far away* from us there might be regions of space that obey different
  effective laws of physics. In the same way that water can be in a state of
  solid, liquid, and gas, space might analogously have states resulting in
  different laws of physics.

- **The Level III multiverse:** The many-worlds interpretation of quantum
  mechanics.

- **The Level IV multiverse:** All mathematical structures.

Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) is essentially this:

> The universe we inhabit not only is described by a mathematical structure, but
> *is* a mathematical structure. Moreover, all mathematical structures
> physically exist.

I find it more intuitive to phrase it like this:

> Mathematical existence is equivalent to physical existence.

Or, in the way that makes the most sense to me:

> Some mathematical structures describe worlds that contain self-aware beings.
> Just by the existence of the mathematical structure, those self-aware beings
> are indeed concious and self-aware. You don't have to add any special sauce to
> the mathematical structure to make it "real."

I won't summarize Tegmark's arguments for the MUH, or its implications. If you
don't have time to read the book and would like a quick technical read, see
Tegmark's "[Is the "theory of everything" merely the ultimate ensemble
theory?](http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9704009)" I highly recommend reading that
paper even if you're going to read the book.

I have a more personal connection to this book than I do to most books. After
I learned about computability and the Church-Turing thesis in university,
I couldn't help but think of everything in terms of computation. In some of my
courses, especially philosophy ones, I couldn't help but think, "You're trying
to understand this in human terms. No wonder it's not making sense. Just think
about it in terms of computation and then it will!"

Understanding computability theory is liberating because it broadens your view
of what's possible in principle. Before I understood computability, I thought in
terms of what's practically possible, so lots of crazy ideas that I should have
taken seriously seemed out of the question. Once you have a good understanding
of computation, it's easy to imagine a Turing machine running for
a doubly-exponential number of steps, using a doubly-exponential amount of
memory, in order to find the answer to some problem. Once you can imagine
mathematical objects with that sort of scale, all of the crazy ideas suddenly
seem mundane.

This kind of thinking eventually lead me to an idea similar to, and probably
equivalent to, the MUH. Rather than being mathematical structures as Tegmark
puts it, to me universes are merely computations. Not a *simulation*, carried
out by some alien life form, rather *just* the computation, expressed, for
example, by writing down a Turing machine whose execution describes how the
universe changes over time. You don't even have to do the computation, the
mathematical existence of the Turing machine is enough.

After keeping the idea in the back of my mind for years, I came across the
above-linked paper of Tegmark's. It was so refreshing to see the crazy ideas I'd
been having written down, and by an MIT professor no less! I immediately bought
"Our Mathematical Universe", and I was not disappointed. Nothing is missing.
Every argument and counter-argument that I had ever thought of regarding my pet
Turing machine universe theory is considered in the book, and there are lots of
new arguments and counterarguments that I hadn't considered.

One of Tegmark's really great insights is that what appears randomness to an
observer is really the observer being cloned. Here's a thought experiment to
illustrate the point: After you fall asleep, a precise clone of you, including
all of your mental state, is created. When you wake up, the experimenter gives
you a number. One clone is given 0, the other is given 1. Before you go to
sleep, because the cloning process is so precise, you have no way to predict
which number you'll see when you wake up, so what you experience is randomness,
even though from the experimenter's point of view, the process is deterministic.

Another way subjective randomness can arise, which I don't think Tegmark
mentions in the book, is given by computational complexity. Complexity theory
can put a lower bound on the amount of time a computer needs to compute
a function. If nature computes the solutions to laws of physics faster than you
can in your brain, then you'll have no prediction in advance of what is going to
happen, and you'll experience randomness. You could, in principle, keep
computing your prediction even after what you're trying to predict happened, to
prove to yourself that it wasn't *really* random. That could keep you busy for
a long time, though, since if P != NP then the same cryptography that's
protecting your connection to this website could make it longer than the age of
the universe!

There are a lot of great ideas in "Our Mathematical Universe," and not just ones
related to the MUH. If you like the intersection of mathematics, physics, and
computer science, I highly recommend it. If the conclusion is hard for you to
stomach, you can think of it as hard science fiction, and you'll enjoy it just
as much.
