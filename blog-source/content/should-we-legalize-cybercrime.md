Cybercrime is illegal. When a cybercriminal gets caught hacking into Google's
servers or distributing ransomware, they'll be punished by the law. To decide
whether or not to carry out an attack, a cybercriminal considers three
big-picture items:

1. The value they expect gain for themselves by attempting the attack.
2. The probability of getting caught.
3. The punishment they expect to receive if they do get caught.

The threat of punishment is meant to deter cybercriminals from carrying out
their attacks. In theory, increasing the probability of getting caught, or
increasing the punishment, should reduce the amount of cybercrime. It will, but
there's a cost.

By having excellent OPSEC practices and correctly taking advantage of
technologies like Tor, the cybercriminal can make their probability of getting
caught as small as they would like. In order to catch criminals hiding behind
these technologies, law enforcement will need ever broader access to information
on the Internet. Moving forward this way, we're trading off the cybercriminals'
for the governments' access to our online lives. Who would you rather have in
your computer, a cybercriminal looking to make a quick buck off your data then
leave, or your government? If you're less of a fan of the government having
access to your stuff, then you ought not to support increasing the criminals'
probability of getting caught.

Making the punishments more severe is a poor idea too. We've see
[again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) and
[again](https://scott.arciszewski.me/blog/2014/03/black-and-white-2600-article)
people being prosecuted under cybercrime law for "crimes" that shouldn't have
been crimes. Skilled cybercriminals will avoid the punishments. They will land
on innocent hackers and security researchers who are only trying to protect us.
Even if the system could correctly distinguish between security researcher and
cybercriminal, the criminals will inevitably frame innocents for their crimes.
As long as it is easier and more likely for an innocent person to be convicted
than themselves, they don't have to worry about getting caught.

If we let law enforcement increase its chance of catching the criminals, we get
a bad outcome. If we increase the punishments for cybercrime, we get a different
bad outcome. Maybe we should think about decreasing both.

What if we legalize cybercrime?
---------------------------------

Imagine a world where cybercrime – hacking, ransomware, DDoS, etc. – is entirely
legal.

With no law to hide behind, companies will put a much more serious effort into
making products that are secure from day one. The "Nobody will do this because
it's illegal!" excuse is gone. With no chance of remediation, companies will be
responding to the successful attacks on their own. They will design their
systems to survive a breach and they will push for more secure industry-wide
standards. The standard for payment on the Internet should not allow itself to
be stolen out of a database dump as easily as a credit card number is.

Worried about cyberwar? Country A is at war with Country B. For the last
5 years, all forms of criminal hacking have been legal in Country A. Country
B wastes resources trying to catch and punish criminal hackers. Which country's
infrastructure is more robust and harder to attack? Who will win the cyberwar?

On top of all of that, we would have a thriving industry of security researchers
finding and fixing the flaws in the products we use every day – without fear.

Of course, legalizing cybercrime overnight would create chaos. But over time,
the chaos would subdue to reveal a robust digital economy that's secured by code
and mathematics, having no need for law.
