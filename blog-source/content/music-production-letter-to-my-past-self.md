In this post, I'm going to pretend that I've been given a chance to send some
advice back to my past self at the time when I was just starting out with EDM
production. My goal is to say everything I can that would help me get from
*there* to *here* as quickly as possible.

## Background & Disclaimer

Over the past few months, I feel like I've finally begun to understand which
skills need to be learned to become a good producer and what I need to do to
learn them. I'm writing this post this now, instead of in the future when I'll
presumably be a lot better, because the confusions and mistakes I've been making
are still clear in my mind.

I'm by no means an expert or even advanced level at this stuff. Professional
mixes sound much better than [mine](https://soundcloud.com/earthrise5), so
I know that I still have a lot to learn. Please don't take this as gospel.
I'll start with what should be the platinum rule of music production advice:

**Platinum Rule:** Always break the rules if it sounds good, and never let
anyone else's advice stop you from trying *everything* to see how it sounds. Even
if there *were* things you should always do or never do, it's crucial that
you do the opposite many, many times in order to understand *why* that's the
case.


What, exactly, are you learning?
-------------------------------------------

EDM production isn't a single skill, it's made up from, at the very least, the
following different skills. In order of importance (approximately, and in my
opinion):

1. Technical audio processing and FX knowledge
2. Mixing & mastering
3. Musical creativity and an ear for meaningful sounds and melodies
4. Music theory
5. Knowing your DAW so well that you can use it extremely quickly
6. Sound design

My past self would have been really surprised by my prioritization here.
When I started out I would think back to when I first heard a Skrillex track,
how his unique FM bass sound design revolutionized the sound of EDM. I wanted to
replicate that novelty and innovation. So, back then, I would have put sound
design as as the first priorty, and I ended up wasting tons of time chasing
sound design tricks to rival Skrillex's FM basses in novelty and impact.

This was a mistake, because Skrillex happened to create his art at a time when
the "design space" of possible sounds had not already been mined to death by
thousands and thousands of artists, and the real reason his music was so
revolutionary at the time is that he was excellent at communicating emotion
though sound. The world had not yet woken up to the potential for harsh
electronic basses to communicate those particular feelings. His innovation was
not a novel sound design (people had used FM basses before him), it was to
successfully and powefully communicate an emotion through sound.

If you need more convincing, like my past self probably would have, then listen
to "With You, Friends" or pay attention to the bassless sections in "Scary
Monsters and Nice Sprites" and notice how much emotion you feel.

To communicate feelings through sound, you need a lot of skills (2) and (3),
mixing and musical creativity. Musical creativity is important for coming up
with the emotional idea itself and the unique and interesting parts that will
convey the emotion, but in my opinion great mixing is the most important. I'll
try to explain why.

### Mixing

Great mixing is *essential* to conveying feeling in music. Take any great track and
boost harsh frequencies in some of its parts, or boost the muddy midrange. No
matter how great and hard-hitting the drop was musically, those added mistakes
will take away from the listener's enjoyment, even if the listener doesn't
realize it and couldn't even describe what the differences are. Harsh
frequencies will stop the listener from turning the track up and really getting
into the drop; loud mids or bass will mask emotionally-important sounds and
might have listener subconsciously worrying their music is too loud and they're
annoying the neighbours; masked sounds will not generate the kind of impact and
emotion that they have the potential to.

Have you ever been disappointed by the sound of a live concert, compared to the
same artist's album tracks? That was because at the concert you were hearing
a bad mix. The live singer's voice was missing all of the care and attention
that a mix engineer put into processing the vocal for maximum emotional impact
on the album.

"Mixing" is a terrible name for this skill. It suggests mixing has only to do
with combining together the different instruments in your track: setting levels
and basic EQing and compression. It's really much, much, deeper. Whenever you
hear "mixing", you should really think "*an ability to recognize and name subtle
sonic differences and knowledge of how to control them to affect a feeling and
clarity in the finished track*." In this view, mastering is just the same skill
applied to the master bus.

Great mixing is necessary for sure, but it's also *sufficient* in a way. Great
mixing can carry your track to some degree, at least for some listeners like me,
even if it's lacking in musical creativity. If you can make me feel like I'm
part of a sonic environment, and your bass, chords, and lead all sound huge and
powerful together, I'll probably like your track even if the melody isn't the
greatest. Even sound design isn't that important when you have great mixing: you
can make pretty great tracks with little more than well-mixed and well-arranged
saw waves and square waves, but of course unique sounds will make your tracks
even better!

This has been my biggest change in my thinking since back then. My focus has
shifted from chasing novel sounds to learning about and controlling the
subtlties of sound. I now consider mixing to be the primary and all-encompasing
skill. I only have technical knowledge ahead of it on this list because I think
it would be pretty damn hard (if not impossible) to mix without understanding
the tools.

Now, let's get into some technical nitty-gritty.

## Technical Stuff

### Technical knowledge about audio and effects

- read the manual of your daw and synths and whatever plugins you get

### Workflow

- cyclical process, give an example of how I liked a track with shitty chords
  for weeks/months then went back and added in highs or something

### Referencing

- reference your own shit
- time between comparison (even a second of silence can fuck it up)

### Reverse-engineering

- at least get an arrangement you like

### Clipping the master

### EQing

Unfortunately, mixing is probably the hardest of these skills to learn, because
it's not something you can learn conceptually and logically like math or
philosohpy. To learn mixing, you need hundreds of hours of experience to wire
a (probably) low-level neural net in your brain to recognize subtle differences
in sound. Professional mix engineers can recognize by ear the difference between
a smallish boost at 2kHz and 3kHz, for example, and they can feel the subtle
extra "oomph" a compressor adds to a drum kit. They can' do this because
thoughout their mixing career they've messed with those subtle properties of
sound that their brain

- eq curves will look insane, and you'll have EQ after EQ doing contradictory
  shit... this is what will happen if you really follow your ear

- high pass everything, midrange

- separation between bass and everything else

- dynamic EQ for cutting harshness w/o changing tonality

### Compression

- find the OTT-like sound
- increasing dynamic range transients

### Distortion

- decapitator on vocals in busy drop
- low mix of high distortion

### Reverb & delay

valhalla vintageverb

### Percussion transients

### Music theory without memorizing a bunch of crap

- can definitely be put off, you can use the same chord progression thoughout
  your entire track

## Pyschological & Artistic Stuff

### Finish lots of tracks, but be willing to revisit them

### Mise-en-place, make your computer feel like home

- I neglected organizing and customizing this computer cuz I just used it for
  music

### Stay in love with music, don't get discouraged

- can literally use the same chord progression throughout the entire track
- make music for your future self

VSTs that are essential to my production
---------------------------------------------------

Here are my favorite VST plugins that I would tell my past self to buy
immediately. To make it onto this list list, a plugin must be essential for
something I do on nearly every track and be special enough that I'd almost never
reach for an alternative (no paid promotion here!).

- [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum) is my go-to synthesizer.
  I love it because its user interface is so intuitive compared to other synths.
  You can visually see what's going on, and the way that you wire up envelopes
  and LFOs is super straightforward. It's popular too, so there are so lots of
  presets available on the Internet. Don't get too caught up trying to design
  sounds completely in Serum using only its built-in effects, I get better
  results when I use it to generate bright full-spectrum sounds that I then
  process and filter in my DAW.
- [Valhalla
  VintageVerb](https://valhalladsp.com/shop/reverb/valhalla-vintage-verb/) would
  be my choice if I could only have one reverb. I struggled for a long time trying to
  get Pro-R and others to sound good; Valhalla VintageVerb is great
  out-of-the-box for what I usually want to acheive. I felt like I really
  started to "understand" reverb once I started playing with this plugin.
- [Decapitator](https://www.soundtoys.com/product/decapitator/). In the same
  way that I didn't start to "get" reverb until I had VintageVerb, I didn't
  really understand how to use distortion until I got decapitator. I use it
  a lot on vocals in busy/bright drops, some of the distortion modes sound
  incredible in that context!
- [FabFilter Pro-Q
  3](https://www.fabfilter.com/products/pro-q-3-equalizer-plug-in) is important
  in my mixes because Ableton's built-in EQ only lets you cut or boost +/-12db
  which is often not enough to cut out a really muddy midrange. Pro-Q 3's
  dynamic EQ feature has been crucial lately in helping me get rid of harshness
  and muddiness in my mixes.
- [FabFilter Pro-MB](https://www.fabfilter.com/products/pro-mb-multiband-compressor-plug-in).
  I usually have Pro-MB on the master of my tracks to compress and cut down
  a lot of midrange and boost highs with an almost OTT-like sound. You can do
  the same stuff with Ableton's built-in multiband compressor, but Pro-MB is so
  much easier to use because its interface is so much better.
- [soothe2](https://oeksound.com/plugins/soothe2/) is a super unique plugin that
  can cut the loudest/harshest frequencies out of a sound automatically.
  However, I most commonly use it in side-chain mode to cut one track's
  frequencies out of another track, only when the first track is active, to make
  things clearly audible without tons of mixing automation.

Other great resources
-------------------------

- [The House of Kush](https://www.youtube.com/user/KushAudio). You should watch
  ALL of his videos. It will help you understand mixing conceptually, and
  motivate you to try things out. Notably, there are *no* sound samples in his
  videos, it's just him talking, which is what makes the channel so great.
- [In the DAW](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCabgQ6X3JNb-z58Uil-wnmQ). You
  can learn a lot here by watching great artists walk though and explain their
  project files.
