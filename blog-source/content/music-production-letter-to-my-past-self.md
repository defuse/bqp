In this post, I'm going to pretend that I've been given a chance to send some
advice back to my past self at the time when I was just starting out with EDM
production. My goal is to say everything I can that would help me get from
*there* to *here* as quickly as possible.

[TOC]

## Background & disclaimer

Over the past few months, I feel like I've finally begun to understand which
skills need to be learned to become a good producer and what I need to do to
learn them. I'm writing this post this now, instead of in the future when I'll
presumably be a lot better, because the confusions and mistakes I've been making
are still clear in my mind.

I'm by no means an expert or even advanced level at this stuff. Professional
mixes sound much better than [mine](https://soundcloud.com/earthrise5), so
I know that I still have a lot to learn. Please don't take this as gospel.
I'll start with what should be the platinum rule of music production advice:

**Platinum Rule:** Always break the rules if it sounds good, and never let
anyone else's advice stop you from trying *everything* to see how it sounds. Even
if there *were* things you should always do or never do, it's crucial that
you do the opposite many, many times in order to understand *why* that's the
case.

Seriously, take that to heart, because early on I heard a lot of bad advice like
"you should always make EQ cuts and rarely ever use boosts" that stopped me from
trying everything out and learning properly.

TODO: this really needs a spell check


What, exactly, are you learning?
-------------------------------------------

EDM production isn't a single skill, it's made up from, at the very least, the
following different skills. In order of importance (approximately, and in my
opinion):

1. Mixing & mastering
2. Musical creativity and developing an ear for meaningful sounds
3. Technical audio processing and FX knowledge
4. Music theory
5. Knowing your DAW so well that you can use it extremely quickly
6. Sound design
7. Building a sample library and becoming familiar with it.

My past self would have been really surprised by my prioritization here.
When I started out I would think back to when I first heard a Skrillex track,
how his unique FM bass sound design revolutionized the sound of EDM. I wanted to
replicate that novelty and innovation. So, back then, I would have put sound
design as as the first priorty, and I ended up wasting tons of time chasing
sound design tricks to rival Skrillex's FM basses in novelty and impact.

This was a mistake, because Skrillex happened to create his art at a time when
the "design space" of possible sounds had not already been mined to death by
thousands and thousands of artists, and the real reason his music was so
revolutionary at the time is that he was excellent at communicating emotion
though sound. The world had not yet woken up to the potential for harsh
electronic basses to communicate those particular feelings. His innovation was
not a novel sound design (people had used FM basses before him), it was to
successfully and powefully communicate an emotion through sound.

If you need more convincing, like my past self probably would have, then listen
to "With You, Friends" or pay attention to the bassless sections in "Scary
Monsters and Nice Sprites" and notice how much emotion you feel.

To communicate feelings through sound, you need to develop a lot of skills (1)
and (2): mixing experience and musical creativity. Musical creativity is really
important, but I shouldn't really say anything about it here, because it's your
own unique tastes and ideas that will give your music that spark. All of the
music you've ever listened to in your life contributes to that creativity.
Mixing, on the other hand, is something common to all music and I think it's by
far the most important skill to develop. In the next section I'll try to explain
why I think that.

### Mixing's importance

Have you ever been disappointed by the sound of a live concert compared to the
same artist's album tracks? That was because at the concert you were hearing
a bad mix. The live singer's voice was missing all of the care and attention
that some mix engineer somewhere put into processing the vocal for maximum
emotional impact on the album.

Great mixing is *essential* to conveying feeling in music. Take any great track
and boost harsh frequencies in the chords or boost the muddy midrange in a bass.
No matter how great and hard-hitting the drop was musically, those added
mistakes will take away from the listener's enjoyment, even if the listener
doesn't realize it and couldn't even describe what the differences are. Harsh
frequencies will stop the listener from turning the track up really loud and
getting into the drop; overly-loud mids or bass might mask the emotion coming
from other important sounds and might even make the listener worry their music
is too loud and annoying the neighbours.

"Mixing" is a terrible name for this skill. It suggests mixing has only to do
with combining together the different instruments in your track: setting levels
and basic EQing and compression. It's really much, much, deeper. Whenever you
hear "mixing", you should really think *"an ability to recognize and name subtle
sonic differences combined with practical knowledge of how to control those
differences to affect a feeling and create clarity in the finished track."*

In this view, "mastering" is just the same skill applied to the master bus.
I don't consider mastering a separate process at all, you should be paying
attention "mastering"-type details, like differences in loudness between
sections, when you're "just mixing". If you need to put something on the master
bus to acheive a certain sound while you're "just mixing", then do it!

As this near-rant I'm on suggests, my biggest change in thinking has been
a shift in focus from chasing novel sounds to learning about and controlling the
subtlties of sound. I now consider mixing to be a primary and pretty much
all-encompasing skill. Ultimately your goal should be to have masterful control
over the little details in all that you produce, *not* to find a "trick" that
will make your music stand out.

Now, let's get into some technical nitty-gritty to hopefully help with your
mixes.

## Technical stuff

### Read the manuals

Technical knowledge comes third on my piority list because, compared to the
low-level neural rewiring that needs to take place in order to have an ear for
fine mixing details, learning the technical information about how sound and
audio effects actually work is super straightforward. It's just "textbook
knowledge", the kind of thing you could teach at a school, it doesn't depend on
any kind of creativity. This is something my past self got right early on and
I'm *super* grateful for it.

You should try to understand at least the basics of Fourier transforms, how an
arbitrary signal can be thought of as a sum of sine waves of various freqencies
and phases. You don't need all of the mathematical detail but this is pretty
important for understanding what an EQ is actually doing to your sound. The more
you know about this the better, for example you'll understand why you get
a clicking sound if you suddenly start or stop a low-frequency bass (because in
order to create an abrupt change in the signal, there needs to be high-frequency
sine waves in the mix) and you'll have a better sense for what's possible to do
in principle with any given audio effect.

It's a really good idea to throughly read through the manual for your DAW to
understand all of its audio effects what they are doing to the audio at a low
level. It's a whole other thing to actually experiment with the effects and
understand how they sound, but learning what they actually do is pretty
straightforward since it's just a matter of reading a manual! The technical
knowledge will help you experiment.

### Music theory without memorizing a bunch of crap

I won't say much about music theory but one thing I will mention is that it can
seem really daunting to have to memorize 12 different keys and scales, not to
mention all of the incomprehensible terminology associated with music theory.
None of that is really necessary, even though conforming to music theory is
pretty important. There are redundancies in music theory that you can exploit to
write tracks in any key you want without having to memorize anything.

Consider the keys on the piano that make up the C major and A minor scale (easy,
they're the white keys). If you were to shift all of the keys up seven semitones
so that when you play a C, you really hear the note G and when you play an A,
you really hear the note E, then the white keys are now the G major and E minor
scales! This works for any key you want, so if you want to write a song in F#
minor, for example, just add a MIDI pitch effect that shifts all the piano keys
up however much you need to to turn the A key into an F# (-3 or +9), and now you
can play the F# minor scale on the white keys!

By doing this, I've managed to avoid memorizing the keys and the only downsides
are that I can't play on a regular piano in any key, and if someone gives me
a chord name like GMaj7 it's a pain to convert that into something I understand.
(If you use understand the circle of fifth's it's actually not so bad to memorize
the keys, but I don't have time for that!)

From there you should learn about triads and roman numeral notation for chords
(e.g. I-IV-V-I is a chord progression made by triads starting on the first,
fourth, fifth, and back to first notes of whichever key you're in). Learning it
abstractly like this, instead of trying to know the note-based names for every
chord and memorize which key they belong to will save even more memorization
work. I recommend learning this from the first several lectures of [this
course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_yOVARO2Oc&list=PL9LXrs9vCXK56qtyK4qcqwHrbf0em_81r).

The only other thing I'll say about music theory is that it really helps to pick
a chord progression to start your track. Steal a good one if you need to, it'll
help get some emotion into your track really quickly which will hopefully
inspire you to with ideas for what to do next. If you're lazy like me, you can
let the same chord progression repeat throughout your entire track and still end
up with a pretty good result but obviously you can do much better with
meaningful harmonic variation.

At some point I'll put in the effort to memorize all this music theory stuff. :-)

### Workflow and arrangement

I think this is a pretty common question and something I wondered about a lot.
Just what do producers *do* when they're creating a track? What do they start
with? When do they do what?

It's easy to think this is the most important thing and that what you have to do
is learn and memorize a workflow for building a track. That's somewhat true but
only in the sense that you find yourself doing the same things repeatedly
because you know *from experience* that you'll like the result. What you will
*not* be doing is following a do-this-then-do-that recipe.

The creative flow actually works more like this: First, lay down something that
inspires you. It could be some chords, drum groove, or even a single sound from
a sample that makes you feel some kind of emotion. Then, let the inspiration
from what you're currently hearing guide you in coming up with ideas for what to
do next. For example if you have a sad and nostalgic chord progression,
listening to it might give you an idea for which kind of instrument should play
them. This process repeats in a loop: *you're aiming to always be inspired by
what you're hearing to generate new ideas and to keep you motivated to work on
the track.* In the early stages of a track, you'll likely be inspired to add
musical content (chords, melodies, drums, etc.) and it will gradually shift to
mixing-type stuff like making the drums hit harder, tweaking the sound of the
chords, and so on, but it can happen *in any order, do it in the order that's
most fun for you*.

If the track you're working on stops inspiring you, then either it's time to
take a break from that track for a while or it's time to recklessly delete some
of the stuff you've spent hours on to make space for fresh ideas.

To help with this process, though, it is useful to understand the general
structure of the kinds of tracks you want to make. A good way to do that is to
pick a few favorite tracks, drag them into your DAW, and put time markers at all
the section changes. Give the sections all names that make sense to you (verse
1, verse 2, drop 1....) and write out everything you notice is going on in each
section, what the key differences between them are (volume, brightness/darkness,
speed, rhythmic differences, etc.), and what happens at the transitions between
the sections. Don't get too caught up in the details of the tracks you're
looking at though (that's a really easy way to get discouraged!), the point is
just to get a general sense for what kinds of sections you will typically need
to make to have a complete track.

Once you have a sense for what all goes into a a track in terms of the different
sections and their relationship, make a *lot* of tracks that are "finished" in
the sense that they have all of the necessary parts. This is something I'm
pretty glad I did, because you'll need to have those same kinds of sections in
every track you make and it really helps to have practice at making each kind of
section. (I actually wish I heeded this advice even more closely, because if you
listen to my build-up sections they're terrible compared to my drops and
verses, because I always half-assed the builds and so I don't have as much
experience making good ones.)

- ABCD method to writing drops and verses

### Don't make changes to tracks while they're soloed

### EQing

Unfortunately, mixing is probably the hardest of these skills to learn, because
it's not something you can learn conceptually and logically like math or
philosohpy. To learn mixing, you need hundreds of hours of experience to wire
a (probably) low-level neural net in your brain to recognize subtle differences
in sound. Professional mix engineers can recognize by ear the difference between
a smallish boost at 2kHz and 3kHz, for example, and they can feel the subtle
extra "oomph" a compressor adds to a drum kit. They can' do this because
thoughout their mixing career they've messed with those subtle properties of
sound that their brain

- eq curves will look insane, and you'll have EQ after EQ doing contradictory
  shit... this is what will happen if you really follow your ear

- high pass everything, midrange

- separation between bass and everything else

- dynamic EQ for cutting harshness w/o changing tonality

- dont use solo button

### Compression

There are at least four important distinct uses of compression that I am aware
of. These are: side-chain compression, "distortion-like" compression, "rhythmic
pumping" compression, and compression for transient control.

#### Side-chain compression

Side-chain compression is not really compression, it's just using a compressor
on one track that's side-chained to another track, so that the first track ducks
out of the way of the side-chained track's signal whenever it is active.
Typically the bass is side-chain compressed with the kick so that the low
frequencies of the bass and the kick don't phase-cancel each other.

It's crucial to have precise control over the shape of the ducking that occurs,
so you almost never want to side-chain with the actual kick. If you side-chain
to the actual kick or snare sample, then you can't change that sample without
changing the character of the side-chain compression. It's better to have
independent control over the sample and the side-chaining. So I prefer to use
LFOTool in MIDI-trigger mode to draw in a custom side-chain curve that gets
triggered automatically each time the kick hits.

Another way to do this is to have a separate "click" track that plays a really
short click (not sent to the master, so it's not audible) to trigger the
side-chain compressor. In this setup, you want the compressor to have a really
high ratio (even infinite), fast attack (so that it "sees" the short click) and
then you can control the shape of the side-chain ducking using the compressor's
release time.

#### Distortion-like compression

Another use of compression, especially in EDM, is as a kind of sound design
trick that's actually closer to distortion than compression. When I'm doing
regular compression to control dynamics, like to make a loud master, I usually
start by putting the compressor into this kind of a configuration and then
backing it off, so this is pretty important to understand.

OTT is a really popular effect that makes use of this principle. First, stick an
OTT on something (like a reverby bass guitar or piano) to get a sense for what
that sounds like. In addition to boosting the highs, you'll notice that it has
a certain special "sound" to it. In some cases this sound is almost the essense
of EDM.

You can recreate that same "sound" with a normal compressor. Set a high ratio
and a super fast attack and super fast release, and a threshold below the
average level of the signal. It should sound pretty awful and distorted. Now,
back off the release (make it longer), and you should notice it starts to sound
less awful and more like the special OTT "sound" (without boosting the highs as
much).

What's happening is that with an extremely fast attack and release, the
compressor is essentially applying a distortion curve to the signal. If the
attack and release were literally 1 sample long, it would be equivalent to
a waveshaping distortion curve. As the release gets longer, the effect moves
away from pure distortion into a region that's more like a mixture of distortion
and compression.

I use this a lot as a sound design trick on bass guitars and stuff like that, by
putting the compressor *after* a reverb. If you like the particular kind of
sound OTT creates but want it to be more subtle, then this is a great trick.

If you just want to use compression to control dynamics, but you struggle to
"hear" what the compressor is doing as I did, start by pushing the compressor
into this almost-distorting region to make it really obvious, then back it off
(make the release longer) until it's controlling the dynamics how you would like
without distorting.

#### Rhythmic pumping compression

This kind of compression I honestly don't know much about and I don't have the
"ear" to set correctly. The idea is to put a compressor on a bus that has
a bunch of different elements (even the master sometimes). Loud things like the
kick and snare will trigger the compressor, and a carefully-set longish release
will create a rhythmic pumping effect in time with the music. I'm sure this is
a really important use of compression in certain genres but I don't use it all
that often.

#### Compression for transient control

You can also use compression to add or remove transients from a percussion
sample (for example).

To remove a transient, just use a fast attack time so the compressor reacts
quickly and brings down the transient closer to the level of the remaining body
of the sound. Make sure the release is fast enough so that the compressor isn't
also reducing the level of the body, but not so fast that it's distorting.

You can also add a transient this way. Suppose we're working with a signal that
has no transient, i.e. it's all pretty much the same level. First, apply an
extreme amount of compression with a super fast attack time. This should just
bring down the volume of the sound with no real change. Now, open up the attack
time, so that it takes longer for the compressor to react. If you set the attack
time to 50ms, say, then you'll get a loud 50ms-ish transient at the start of the
sound while the compressor is waiting to react.

When you're adding a transient, controlling the attack time also controls the
amount of mid / low frequencies that make it into the transient. When the attack
is short, the transient will be short, and so it can only contain
short-wavelength high frequencies. As the attack time increases, the duration of
the transient increases, and you'll start to hear lower frequencies in the
transient. Try this out on a bassy kick sample to hear what I mean.

### Distortion

The most obvious way to use distortion is as a sound design tool, such as how an
electric guitar's signal is distorted to acheive its characteristic sound.

Distortion is also an extremely important mixing tool for making midrangey
things (like vocal chops) audible in a loud and bright mix without having to
bring their levels up too much and eat up all the headroom. My favorite plugin
for this is Decapitator, by the way, because for some reason I find it easier to
get good-sounding distortion from it than I can using Ableton's saturator. I'd
recommend trying it if you've been struggling with distortion.

This is an example of when you really *don't* want to use the solo button. When
you use it as a mix tool like this, the distortion will add high frequency
content to the sound, which you'll probably think is really gross when the track
is soloed. But, in the context of a bright mix, the bright highs of the rest of
the mix will mask the ugly distorted frequencies, and the result will be that
the distorted sound is simply more audible in the context of the mix.

Subltey is key when it comes to distortion. I find that it's helpful to use more
extreme levels of distortion with less dry/wet mix (so that there's lots of
distortion but it's quiet), instead of using less distortion on 100%. Think of
the amount of distortion (i.e. the gain with which you're pushing the signal
into the distortion) as shaping the tone of what the distortion sounds like and
the dry/wet knob is there to set the amount of that tone that you want to hear.

There's a problem with that, though, which is that when you use a dry/wet knob,
turning it more to the wet side will reduce the volume of the original signal.
Usually, that's not what you want, if you're trying to make something more
audible in a mix. Usually, it's better to add distortion in parallel, so the dry
signal remains the same volume, and you mix in a small amount of the
heavily-distorted signal. To do that, you can either set up a parallel effect
rack with the fully-distorted signal on one channel and fully-dry signal on
another, and then bring in the distortion by raising the gain of the distorted
channel. If your distortion effect has an output gain knob, you can also acheive
this more quickly by leaving the dry/wet around 10% (so the dry signal isn't
attenuated very much) and boosting the distorted signal like crazy so that it's
audible even though it's only on 10% wet. (Decapitator makes this really easy.)

It's crucial to understand that distortion is nonlinear, so the level of the
signal going into the distortion effect will change how it sounds. You have to
set the level of the signal going into the distortion very carefully to get the
kind of tone that you want. Sometimes you will need to boost a signal by a lot
before it goes into the distortion and then bring it down back to a reasonable
level after the distortion. If your input signal varies in level by a lot, then
the loud parts will get distorted noticably more than the quiet parts.

### Reverb & delay

valhalla vintageverb

### Percussion transients

Something I used to really neglect was control over my kick and snare
transients. In a loud drop with bright basses and chords, it's essential that
your kick and snare have strong transients to cut through the mix and sound
powerful. You can add a transient either using a compressor as discussed above
or by layering the transient from another sample with whatever sample you
already have. If you're layering samples, make sure to high-pass one or the
other so that their low and midrange frequencies don't end up cancelling each
other out.

(This is another reason not to side-chain directly to the kick and snare, if you
side-chained directly to the kick then messed with the kick's transient, it
would change the shape of the side-chain ducking, so you'd have to go back and
adjust that compressor again.)

### Mastering: compression and clipping

- don't be afriad of clipping
- multiband compression super helpful (maybe include audio example)
- leave your limiter open so you can see if it's bad
- send some things around the compression
- pay attention to loudness differences between sections: listen to the drop at
  a comfortable volume then switch over to a verse and make sure it has the same
  clarify (shouldn't be as "loud" but things should be just as audible)

### Mix referencing

- reference your own shit
- time between comparison (even a second of silence can fuck it up)

### Mix translation

- relying on very high freq's for presence fails
- auraton
- magic is in the midrange (quote someone)

### Listening environment & headphones

- listen quiet so you have less sound coming from your room and less distortion
  from the speakers

Artistsic and psychological stuff
-----------------------------------------

### Finish lots of tracks, but be willing to revisit them

- some of my best work has come from revisiting tracks I thought were done, this
  helped me learn what needs to improve and where I learned the most about how
  to improve (self referencing)

### Mise-en-place, make your computer feel like home

- I neglected organizing and customizing this computer cuz I just used it for
  music

### Stay in love with music, don't get discouraged

It takes an insane amount of experience (and in most cases multiple people
with insane amounts of experience) to produce the "commercial" tracks that you
love. It's really easy to compare your tracks to your favorites and get super
discouraged to know that your tracks are nowhere near good enough and you have
no idea why or what to fix.

This got so bad for me at one point that I could barely listen to music anymore,
because every time I put on some music I would start to analyze it and
try to figure out why the hell it sounded so good and I felt bad that I was so
far away from acheiving that kind of quality.

To counter these kinds of feelings, I find it helpful to,

- Remind yourself of why you are in love with music in the first place. For me
  it's the ability for music to make me feel like I'm in another place, almost
  like another world with different laws of physics, as well as the rave the
  culture of acceptance. Think back on your most significant memories having to
  do with music and your favorite tracks to remember why you love it so much.
- Recognize that *even if* you end up producing great-sounding music, it's still
  (depending on your marketing skill) a huge roll of the dice whether or not
  you'll actually be recognized and get to play festivals. There are hundreds if
  not thousands of SoundCloud accounts whose music is far better than mine and
  they have, like, no followers. If headlining festivals is your goal, then you
  should absolutely aim for that and give it your best effort, but don't let
  the possibility of failure affect your sense of self-worth.
- Think of music more like mathematical or scientific discovery. Imagine the
  space of all possible 6-minute 48000Hz 32-bit WAV files. It's a huge space,
  astronomically impossible to ever completely search through, but it is
  a well-defined set. You can think of that set like a mathematical object that
  real mathematicians might be interested in studying. A mathematician would
  characterize the simplest of the members as silence, periodic signals, sums of
  peroidic signals, and so on. The vast majority (i.e. a random member) would
  sound like noise. Eventually, the mathematician would discover that certain
  members of the set produce strong emotional feelings in humans when played
  audibly. The mathematician could get really good at "finding" members that
  produce these feelings, at which point they are actually an artist. The line
  between "creation" and "discovery" is really blurred. I suspect the reason
  a lot of artists sometimes feel like a higher power is directing their
  creativity is because creating great music is a lot more like *discovering*
  great music then we might like to think. The space of WAV files is a public
  resource shared between all of us, and so we're all better off when someone
  discovers something new and exciting.
- Make music for yourself. You will find that certain of your tracks will take
  on great emotional meaning *for you* even if nobody else likes them and you
  see tons of flaws in them. Even my very first shitty tracks bring back some
  pretty deep memories of what it was like and how I felt when I first started
  producing.

Becoming a great artist really seems be an exercise in murdering your ego. The
moment you accept that you are great at something is the momemnt you stop trying
to improve. There's a really delicate balance between being proud of what you've
made and recognizing how far you still have to go to acheive mastery. **Learn to

My favorite VSTs
---------------------------------------------------

A common peice of advice is that you really don't need gear and plugins to be
a great producer and that great producers can work with anything they're given.
That's true, but sometimes the right plugin can really help you overcome
hurdles, even if it's only because the user interface or default preset is just
right to help you learn something new.

So here are my favorite VST plugins. I'd tell my beginning past self to get
these immediately and learn them through-and-through. To make it onto this list
list, a plugin must be essential for something I do on nearly every track and it
must have been important to helping me learn how to use that type of effect or
be special enough that I'd almost never reach for an alternative (no paid
promotion here!).

- [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum) is my go-to synthesizer.
  I love it because its user interface is so intuitive compared to other synths.
  You can visually see what's going on, and the way that you wire up envelopes
  and LFOs is super straightforward. It's popular too, so there are so lots of
  presets available on the Internet. Don't get too caught up trying to design
  sounds completely in Serum using only its built-in effects, I get better
  results when I use it to generate bright full-spectrum sounds that I then
  process and filter in my DAW.
- [Valhalla
  VintageVerb](https://valhalladsp.com/shop/reverb/valhalla-vintage-verb/) would
  be my choice if I could only have one reverb. I struggled for a long time trying to
  get Pro-R and others to sound good; Valhalla VintageVerb is great
  out-of-the-box for what I usually want to acheive. I felt like I really
  started to "understand" reverb once I started playing with this plugin,
  probably because its default setting is already really close to what I like.
- [Decapitator](https://www.soundtoys.com/product/decapitator/). In the same
  way that I didn't start to "get" reverb until I had VintageVerb, I didn't
  really understand how to use distortion until I got decapitator. I use it
  a lot on vocals in busy/bright drops, some of the distortion modes sound
  incredible in that context!
- [FabFilter Pro-Q
  3](https://www.fabfilter.com/products/pro-q-3-equalizer-plug-in) is important
  in my mixes because Ableton's built-in EQ only lets you cut or boost +/-12db
  which is often not enough to cut out a really muddy midrange. Pro-Q 3's
  dynamic EQ feature has been crucial lately in helping me get rid of harshness
  and muddiness in my mixes.
- [FabFilter Pro-MB](https://www.fabfilter.com/products/pro-mb-multiband-compressor-plug-in).
  I usually have Pro-MB on the master of my tracks to compress and cut down
  a lot of midrange and boost highs with an almost OTT-like sound. You can do
  the same stuff with Ableton's built-in multiband compressor, but Pro-MB is so
  much easier to use because its interface is so much better.
- [soothe2](https://oeksound.com/plugins/soothe2/) is a super unique plugin that
  can cut the loudest/harshest frequencies out of a sound automatically.
  However, I most commonly use it in side-chain mode to cut one track's
  frequencies out of another track (only when the first track is actually making
  noise), to make things clearly audible without tons of mixing automation.

  2](https://www.fabfilter.com/products/pro-l-2-limiter-plug-in). There's
  nothing too spectacular about this plugin, but it's always on my master bus
  and I leave it open on a second monitor as a loudness/level meter and to make
  sure there are no true peaks above -0.3db because supposedly that's something
  you want to do to make sure your track compresses to MP3 properly (I usually
  have some kind of distortion/saturation before it, so it's very rarely ever
  reducing gain by more than half a dB, but sometimes I do use it legtimately as
  a limiter).

Other great resources
-------------------------

- [The House of Kush](https://www.youtube.com/user/KushAudio). You should watch
  ALL of his videos. It will help you understand mixing conceptually, and
  motivate you to try things out. Notably, there are *no* sound samples in his
  videos, it's just him talking, which is what makes the channel so great.
- [In the DAW](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCabgQ6X3JNb-z58Uil-wnmQ). You
  can learn a lot by watching great artists walk though and explain their
  project files, but don't let it discourage you, they make it seem eaiser than
  it is.
