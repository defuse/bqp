I'm grateful to have been accepted to do a master's degree in quantum
information at the University of Waterloo! Learning and science are my favorite
hobbies, and getting paid (scholarships) to do both is a dream come true. It
wasn't easy to accept the offer, though, since it meant [leaving the Zcash
project](https://z.cash/blog/taylors-next-adventure.html) and having less
opportunities to hang out with the Zcash team.

In my applications to scholarships, I mentioned how science communicators like
Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, and Neil deGrasse Tyson inspire me, how I want to
be like them, and how I'll work hard to popularize my work. I believe creating
new scientists is just as valuable as doing novel research. So, with those
promises in mind, I'll be blogging about some of the cool stuff I learn right
here!

I'm on the road from Calgary to Waterloo right now (thanks to my Dad for driving
me and all my computer crap across the country), so hopefully the first post
will be up in a week or two!
